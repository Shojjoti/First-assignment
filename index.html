                <h4 >My Inspiration</h4>
                    <p>Three years ago, I graduated from State University of New York at Albany for my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. After four years of cramming for exams and coding projects, I decided not to pursue a role that mainly involves coding as my first job. You may be wondering why I chose not to pursue a career in becoming a developer? The main reasons are the different fears I have compiled throughout my journey. I will take you through the main fear that could also be stopping you as well from opening that compiler and how you can regain the passion for coding again.</p>
